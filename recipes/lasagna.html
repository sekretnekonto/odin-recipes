    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind the pork shoulder</li>
        <li>Add the spices to the ground meat:
            <ul>
                <li>A flat tablespoon each of marjoram and Provencal herbs</li>
                <li>A flat teaspoon each of salt, pepper and sweet paprika</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Mix the meat and spices and set aside</li>
        <li>Peel the onion and finely dice it</li>
        <li>Peel the garlic cloves and press them</li>
        <li>Peel and chop large mushrooms into smaller pieces</li>
        <li>Heat a medium-sized frying pan and add four tablespoons of vegetable oil, e.g. grapeseed or rice</li>
        <li>Sauté the onion, garlic, and mushrooms for about five minutes over a slightly higher heat setting. The onion should just begin to translucent</li>
        <li>Add the ground meat with the spices to the pan</li>
        <li>Sauté for a few minutes, until the meat has softened</li>
        <li>Stir the contents of the pan with a wooden spoon, using a spoon to separate the ground meat pieces</li>
        <li>After a few minutes, you can pour in a cup of tomato puree. You can use canned, cartoned, or bottled passata. Also add 200 grams of tomato paste</li>
        <li>Mix the delicious meat and tomato lasagna filling thoroughly and turn off after two minutes. </li>
        <li>Prepare a baking dish for the lasagna. It can be ceramic or glass. Dimensions: 30 x 22 x 6 cm, where 6 cm is the height of the rim. Simply grease the inside of the dish with oil.</li>
        <li>Grate the mozzarella cheese (not the light, pickled kind) using a large grater.</li>
        <li>Grate the yellow cheese using the same grater.</li>
        <li>Place both cheeses together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>To ensure that the lasagna sheets are cooked through and tender, soften them slightly before placing them in the pan.</li>
        <li>Simply pour water into the pan.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat to medium and heat the water until it boils.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low.</li>
        <li>Immerse three sheets in the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove them after about 60 seconds and arrange them on the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Arrange three sheets of soft lasagna noodles side by side.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin but full layer of meat filling over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Spread the grated cheese over the meat filling. Try to distribute it evenly throughout the pan, remembering to leave enough ingredients for the subsequent layers of lasagna.</li>
        <li>Place three more sheets of soft pasta on top of the cheese. Another layer of meat filling, then a layer of cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process for the next two layers. After the fourth layer of pasta, do not add any more meat.</li>
        <li>You can spread the remaining cheese on the pasta sheets.</li>
        <li>You can pour a mixture of milk and sweet cream with a pinch of sweet paprika over the lasagna, or you can make a béchamel sauce and cover the casserole with it.</li>
        <li>Place the baking dish with the ready-to-bake casserole in an oven preheated to 180 degrees Celsius.</li>
        <li>Select the middle rack with the top/bottom heat setting.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna for 50 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take out the lasagna and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
