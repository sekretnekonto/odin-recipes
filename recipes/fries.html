    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Oven fries</strong> are an exceptionally delicious and very popular snack. You can easily make them yourself at home. They're super delicious and come out perfectly crispy. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <em>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg floury potatoes - type C or optionally type B</li>
            <li>1 flat tablespoon of powdered sugar - only for soaking the sliced potatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of frying oil - neutral oil with a high smoke point</li>
            <li>Spices:
                <ul>
                    <li>Half a teaspoon each of salt, Provencal herbs and sweet paprika</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </em>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and thinly peel one kilogram of potatoes.</li>
        <li>Cut each potato lengthwise into slices about 1.5-2 cm thick, then into strips.</li>
        <li>Place the fries in a bowl of cold tap water and rinse.</li>
        <li>Pour the water back into the bowl and rinse the potato strips again. (3-4 times, until the water runs clear).</li>
        <li>Pour very cold water into the bowl one last time.</li>
        <li>Add a level tablespoon of powdered sugar and briefly mix the potatoes with the water and sugar.</li>
        <li>Set the bowl aside for about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>After about 40 minutes, you can pour out all the water and rinse the raw fries thoroughly under cold, running water.</li>
        <li>Transfer the fries to a clean cotton cloth or paper towel.</li>
        <li>Thoroughly dry the fries. They should be perfectly dry and matte.</li>
        <li>Start preheating the oven. Set the convection mode to 200 degrees Celsius (400 degrees Fahrenheit).</li>
        <li>Place the drained fries in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour in two tablespoons of frying oil and seasonings.</li>
        <li>Thoroughly mix the fries with the oil and seasonings.</li>
        <li>Line a large baking tray with baking paper.</li>
        <li>Transfer the potato strips, coated with fat and spices, to the tray.</li>
        <li>Arrange the fries so they don't stack on top of each other.</li>
        <li>Place the baking sheet with the ready-to-bake fries in a well-heated oven.</li>
        <li>The fries were done after 40 minutes, but I left them in the oven longer to brown them a bit more.</li>
        <li>I highly recommend checking the fries' appearance after just 10 minutes of baking.</li>
        <li>Baked fries can be removed from the oven immediately and served while still hot. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
